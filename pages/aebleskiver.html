    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe of the traditional Danish donut, and the author's family favorite affair, a type of spherical donut often served warm, dusted with powder sugar, and with a side of jam.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>1 quarter Buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable shortening, melted</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an electric aebleskiver pan, according to the manufacturer's directions.</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs, buttermilk, and butter in a mixing bowl until smooth. Gradually whisk flour, salt, sugar, baking soda, and cardamom into egg mixture until evenly blended and smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon 1 tablespoon of shortening into each cup of the preheated aebleskive pan, and allow oil to heat. Pour batter into each cup until 3/4 full. Allow batter to cook in the bottom of the cup, 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown. Then use a long skewer or knitting needle to lift one edge and give it a 1/4 turn. The uncooked batter will spill over into the cup, and cook. Continue lifting and turning the edges until batter is fully cooked into a golden brown ball. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
