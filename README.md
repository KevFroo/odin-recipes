# odin-recipes
Part of The Odin Project Foundation Path â€“ Project: Recipes
The project will display a list of links to recipes inside of the same project.
By the end of this project, I will display the basics of HTML: using headings and paragraphs, strong and em, anchors, etc. In addition, I will also be applying what I learnt for git for version control.
